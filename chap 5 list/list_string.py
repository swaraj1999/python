# list vs string

# strings are immutable
# lists are mutable

s="string"
s.title()      
print(s)   #string
t=s.title()
print(t)   #String

# string is not replacing with s with S,immutable,we cant change

l = ["a","b","c"]
l.append("c")
print(l)

# actually c is adding at the end of list,mutable,we can change
